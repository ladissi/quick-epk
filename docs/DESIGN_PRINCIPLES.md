# QuickEPK Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

The EPK should feel like the artist designed it themselves. Not a template with their content dropped in - but a living expression of their aesthetic, generated from their materials.

## Target Persona

**Touring indie band** - They care about their image. They're scrappy but tasteful. They want to look professional without looking corporate. They've probably made their own show posters, have opinions about fonts, and cringe at generic "musician website" templates.

## Value Props

1. **Seamless use** - Creating an EPK feels effortless, almost automatic
2. **Great insights** - Understand what's working, what's not, how to improve
3. **Helps get booked** - Not just a portfolio, but a tool that converts
4. **Proud identity** - Artists are proud to share their QuickEPK, it represents them

## Design Principles

### 1. CONTENT IS SACRED

The artist's photos, music, and words are the art. Our UI is the gallery wall - present, never compete.

- No heavy chrome or UI elements
- The artist's imagery dominates
- Text serves the content, doesn't decorate

### 2. BEAUTY THROUGH RESTRAINT

Fewer elements, more impact. Let negative space speak.

- Resist the urge to fill every pixel
- One strong choice beats three okay ones
- Silence (whitespace) is a design element

### 3. RAW ≠ UNPOLISHED

Intentional imperfection. Grain, not blur. Organic, not broken.

- Texture that feels analog (film grain, noise)
- Typography with character, not just clean
- Movement that breathes, not mechanical easing
- Asymmetry that creates tension

### 4. EVERY EPK IS UNIQUE

Not templates with different colors. The design responds to the artist's content.

- Colors extracted from artist's photos
- Layout adapts to content (photo-heavy vs text-heavy)
- Each EPK should feel like a custom build

### 5. FUNCTIONAL FIRST

A booker has 30 seconds. Bio, music, contact. Beauty serves clarity, never obscures it.

- Critical info accessible immediately
- Music playable in one click
- Contact action always visible
- Mobile-first (bookers review on phones)

## Visual Language

### Typography
- Mix of refined and expressive
- Headlines with character
- Body copy that's readable but not boring
- Consider: space mono, editorial serifs, display faces with personality

### Color
- Driven by artist's photos (extract dominant/accent colors)
- Support both light and dark aesthetics
- Color as atmosphere, not decoration

### Texture
- Subtle grain overlay (like film photography)
- Noise that adds warmth, not distraction
- Depth through layering, not drop shadows

### Motion
- Organic easing (not linear, not overly bouncy)
- Elements that breathe (subtle scale, opacity shifts)
- Parallax that adds depth without disorienting
- Cursor interactions that feel alive

### Layout
- Asymmetric compositions
- Full-bleed imagery
- Editorial influence (magazine spreads, album art)
- Negative space as intentional design element

## References

### Album Art
- Radiohead - Kid A / Amnesiac (digital + analog collision)
- Frank Ocean - Blonde (minimal but deeply felt)
- Tyler, the Creator - Igor (bold, playful, unmistakable)

### Web Experiences
- haw-lin.com (raw editorial energy)
- locomotive.ca (motion that breathes)
- Warm brutalism

### Feeling
- Concert photography, not headshots
- Zine culture, not brochures
- Vinyl sleeve, not Spotify canvas
- The studio at 2am, not the conference room at 10am

## Anti-Patterns (What We Avoid)

- Generic "musician website" templates
- Squarespace-polished soullessness
- Gratuitous animations that don't serve content
- Dark mode as an afterthought
- Cards in grids (the lazy default)
- Stock photo aesthetics
- Corporate color palettes
- "Sign up for our newsletter" energy

## The Test

When an artist shares their QuickEPK, the reaction should be:

> "Damn, this looks good. Did you design this yourself?"

Not:

> "Oh, is this like a Linktree for musicians?"
